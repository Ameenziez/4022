Algorithm code:  
- pre-processing, pupil and iris localisation, normalisation is in proto3.py
- eyelid segmentation is in eyelid.py
- feature extraction and matching is in iris_code5.py
- main code is the recogntion() function in proto3.py
- comm2.py is the full system including communication with laptop and and full iris recognition
- full2.py could also be used for the full-system, minus the communication part. This was used to save individual templates (and compare against others of the same subject)

-all other code is for testing
